Best place to buy cheese is brennans
Butterkase

Wheel dirty
Blowing leaking grease
Heat exchanger rust
Capacitor bad
Fan motor has damage
When air con is running, without the fan, overheating, the compressor over pressurized and release process (not really should do this, but has done multiple times in past couple days) 
Whole unit was hot since fan wasn't blowing heat
175-275 when hot, 400+psi because it trips, should replace motor in near future

They replaced the capacitor

1994 air conditioner 
Furnace is 2003

Furnace is 90% sure it was pulled from another house . . . . kinda rigged up weird

Left side of furnace has a metal patch, so the hole is on the wrong side of the filter

Furnace / Air conditioner should be replaced 


Bearings noise 

New air conditioner / furnace would be ~ 9.5-10.5k, maybe 11.5k 
Duct work
Gas line
PVC pipe should be 2 (but those three are included)

Whole new air cons are coming out soon
Club membership discounts on replacements

Replacing capacitor more often would have helped this, but it's already dying 15m
